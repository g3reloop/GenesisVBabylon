# Netlify Deployment Guide for Genesis V Babylon

## üöÄ Quick Fix Applied

The Netlify configuration parsing error has been fixed! The issue was caused by duplicate `[build.environment]` sections in the `netlify.toml` file.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Consolidated Environment Variables** - Merged duplicate sections
2. **Validated TOML Syntax** - Ensured proper formatting
3. **Commented Problematic Sections** - Disabled plugins that might cause issues
4. **Created Fallback Config** - Added `netlify-simple.toml` as backup

## üîß Netlify Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect Repository
1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com
2. **Click:** "New site from Git"
3. **Select:** GitHub
4. **Choose:** `g3reloop/GenesisVBabylon`

### Step 2: Build Settings
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory:** `out`
- **Node Version:** 18 (or latest)

### Step 3: Environment Variables (Optional)
If you want to use Supabase later:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = your-supabase-url
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your-supabase-anon-key

### Step 4: Deploy
1. **Click:** "Deploy site"
2. **Wait:** Build process completes
3. **Test:** Visit your deployed site

## üìÅ Configuration Files

### Primary: `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  publish = "out"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_VERSION = "9"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-supabase-anon-key"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"

```

### Fallback: `netlify-simple.toml`
```toml
[build]
  publish = "out"
  command = "npm run build"
